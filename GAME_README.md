- **Weighted random selection** - Higher probability = more likely to land
- **Visual feedback** - Segment size reflects rarity

### Power Calculation System
- **Base racial stats** + sub-race bonuses
- **Power bonuses** from all abilities and weapons
- **Stat boost accumulation** from enhancement rounds
- **Synergy bonuses** for matching combinations
- **Final power comparison** determines battle odds

### Battle Determination
- **Win probability** calculated from power difference
- **Final wheel spin** determines actual winner
- **Upset victories possible** - weaker characters can still win!
